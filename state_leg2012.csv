Environment: CEQA Exemption: Recycled Water Pipeline
Status: Failed - ASSEMBLY
Date of Last Action:*  1/5/2011
Author: Jeffries (R)
Topics: Water-Conservation/Efficiency, Water-Resources/Planning
Summary: Amends existing law regarding California Environmental Quality Act environmental impact reports. Exempts a project for the installation of a new pipeline for the distribution of recycled water within an improved public street, highway, or right-of-way. This bill would additionally exempt a project for the installation of a new pipeline, not exceeding a specified length, for the distribution of recycled water within an improved public street, highway, or right-of-way. Because a lead agency, which may include a local agency, is required to determine whether a project qualifies for those exemptions, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

Author: Metzen (DFL)
Topics: Waste-Nuclear/Radioactive
Summary: Relates to energy, regulates projects funded by renewable development account. The public utility that owns the Prairie Island nuclear generating plant must transfer to a renewable development account $500,000 each year for each dry cask containing spent fuel that is located at the Prairie Island power plant for each year the plant is in operation, and $7,500,000 each year the plant is not in operation if ordered by the commission. The fund transfer must be made if nuclear waste is stored in a dry cask at the independent spent-fuel storage facility at Prairie Island for any part of a year. Funds in the account may be expended only for development of renewable energy sources. Projects must be located within the service territory of the public utility, unless the commission finds that a project located outside the service territory would provide significantly more benefits to the public utility's ratepayers than a competing project located within the service territory. The utility that owns a nuclear generating plant is eligible to apply for renewable development fund grants. The utility's proposals must be evaluated by the renewable development fund board in a manner consistent with that used to evaluate other renewable development fund project proposals.

Interbasin Transfers and Flooding
Status: Failed - Indefinitely Postponed
Date of Last Action:*  1/19/2011
Author: Christensen (NP)
Topics: Water-Resources/Planning
Summary: Provides for interbasin transfers during times of flooding as prescribed. The Legislature finds that, for the best management of Nebraska's water resources and for the protection of public and private property, interbasin transfers from one river basin to another river basin during times of flood should be allowed without a permit issued by the department but only pursuant to an agreement between the applicable districts. The board of directors of a natural resources district or an irrigation district in any river basin may establish a written agreement with the board of directors of the natural resources district or an irrigation district in an adjacent river basin to allow interbasin transfers of surface water without a permit pursuant to section 46-233 in order to mitigate public and private property damage when the river draining such river basin is at or above flood stage. Such agreement shall be established in writing prior to the occurrence of such transfer, shall specify that the river basin of destination shall be second in time and second in right to all internal water resources projects within the basin of origin, and shall include, but need not be limited to, any prearranged purchase price of water, where such interbasin transfers can take place, under what conditions such interbasin transfers can take place, and requirements to notify the department and any affected rural water districts, public power and irrigation districts or other special purpose districts in the basin of origin and the river basin of destination.

Author: Parlette (R)
Topics: Water-Resources/Planning

Therefore, the legislature intends for the department of ecology to confer about the effects of a proposed interbasin water rights transfer with the board of commissioners in the county of origin before issuing a permit.
