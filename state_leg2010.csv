Summary: Urges the Public Service Commission to establish a nuclear waste escrow account to receive funds from electric utility customers. High-level radioactive waste is the spent, or used, uranium fuel from nuclear power plants. A typical nuclear power plant in a year generates 20 metric tons of used nuclear fuel. The nuclear industry generates a total of about 2,000 metric tons of used spent fuel. Be it resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives Concurring), that we urge the Michigan Public Service Commission to establish a nuclear waste escrow account to receive the funds collected from Michigan's electric utility customers, which are intended to fund a national nuclear waste repository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and be it further be resolved, that copies of this resolution be transmitted to chairman of the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Hazardous Waste Transporter Fee
Status: Pending - Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee
Date of Last Action:*  1/12/2010
Author: Chiusano (R) Additional Authors: McHose (R)
Topics: Waste-Nuclear/Radioactive
Summary: Concerns hazardous waste transporter fee. This bill would create a quarterly reporting and fee payment cycle for hazardous waste transporters. Under this bill, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) would establish the hazardous waste transporter fee at least 30 days before the beginning of each new quarterly reporting period. Transporters would pay the fee on a quarterly basis within 30 days after the end of each quarterly period,ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. This quarterly schedule will improve the collection of fees by transporters and make the fee payment to the DEP more accurately reflect actual costs, rather than transporters being charged for manifests on a retroactive basis. The bill provides the DEP with the opportunity to adjust the hazardous waste transporter fee quarterly, instead of annually, and the fee may not increase more than $0.50 per ton in any given quarterly reporting period, thus avoiding an abrupt or steep increase in fees in one year.

The return share shall be determined by dividing the total weight of covered electronic devices of that manufacturer's brands by the total weight of covered electronic devices for all manufacturers' brands. The return share by weight shall be determined by multiplying the return share for each such manufacturer by the total weight in pounds of covered electronic devices, including orphan devices, collected from covered entities the previous calendar year. (b) For each manufacturer except those specified in paragraph (c) of this subsection, for 2008 and 2009, determine the return share and return share by weight for each manufacturer calendar years 2008 and 2009 based on the best available public return share data and public weight data from within the United States for covered electronic devices from covered entities. For subsequent calendar years, the return share of covered electronic devices for each manufacturer shall be based on the most recent annual sampling or count of covered electronic devices.

Date of Last Action:*  2/1/2010
Author: Cheney (D)
Topics: Waste and Recycling, Waste and Recycling-Beverage Containers, Waste and Recycling-Product Stewardship
Summary: Proposes to enact a solid waste program under which producers of solid waste designated by the secretary of natural resources would be required to pay for and implement a program for the collection, recycling, and disposition of designated solid wastes, including certain types of packaging. Vermont has endorsed expanded producer responsibility as the preferred policy for managing specific electronic waste, mercury-containing waste, and other specific categories of waste. Extending EPR requirements to all packaging and printed material can result in a solid waste management system that diverts in excess of 60 percent of these wastes from Vermont's landfills. While Vermont's bottle bill diverts a high percentage of those beverage containers included under the regulation, this has resulted in the development of parallel recycling systems for beverage containers and for other recyclable packaging and printed materials. Maintaining two parallel recycling systems results in unnecessarily high costs for consumers, significantly increased vehicle traffic to recycling centers, and a higher carbon footprint for the state. Requirements on solid waste districts and municipalities. Within one year of approval of a program plan for printed material and packaging, municipalities and solid waste districts shall implement mandatory recycling requirements for these designated wastes and shall implement pay-as-you-throw pricing for household waste collection and disposal.
