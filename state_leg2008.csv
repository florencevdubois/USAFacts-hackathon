"Summary: Relates to the Recycling Enhancement Act. An Act concerning the recycling of solid waste, imposing a recycling tax on solid waste generation, amending, supplementing and repealing various sections of statutory law, and making an appropriation. A recycling tax would be levied on: (1) the owner or operator of every solid waste facility at the rate of $3 per ton on all solid waste accepted for disposal or transfer at the solid waste facility, and (2) solid waste collectors at the rate of $3 per ton on all solid waste collected for transshipment or direct transportation to an out-of-state disposal site. The recycling tax would not be imposed on solid waste transported from an in-state transfer station from which the recycling tax has already been levied to an in-state solid waste facility for final disposal. The recycling tax will be considered a ""pass-through"" cost to the solid waste facility owner or operator and solid waste collector and would thus be generated as fees or surcharges ultimately paid by the solid waste generators utilizing these facilities or services. The revenues from the recycling tax would be deposited in the State Recycling Fund. It is estimated that the recycling tax would generate about $34 million annually."
